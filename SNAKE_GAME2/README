basic cave game, created for fun & to test out processing.
- fly close to the walls to accumulate points more quickly.
- if you scrape a wall, you can still continue (with impaired vision) until you have a fatal collision.

NOTE:
there must be a file called highscore.txt in the same directory as SNAKE_GAME2.pde for the game to be able to run.
the contents of the file should start out as simply the number 0, and should contain the high score after the first game.
